# Marketing-Case_NguyenMinhHoang

I simulate some knowledge of basic statistics and applications to compare and analyze outlies in the file Statistic_fb_gg_ads.xlsx. (sample dataset includes marketing campaign results in FB ads and GG ads)
In addition, I have designed an overview table of Marketing Tracking. The goals are as follows:
+ Make sure to understand about Marketing and the function of 2-channel advertising FB ads GG ads. Effectively bring important indicators such as Rev, CVR, ROI (ROAS), CAC NEW?
+ Observe the plan in terms of Spend (cost) and expected Revenue. As well as Actual and Gap. From there, monitor the effectiveness through the management of Actions / Testing / Testing and record measurement and evaluation
+ Observe the detailed breakdown according to the latest and previous week frames to be able to measure - record traffic and detailed performance (Imp, CPI, CPC, CVR, Rev...). This gives the effect of budget allocation and advertising details later on.
